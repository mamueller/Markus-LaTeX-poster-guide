# Markus-LaTeX-poster-guide

This small series of example posters discusses some of the available approaches to create a poster in LaTeX,
in the light commonly faced difficulties.
I focus particularly on the requirements of a template used as part of the corporate identity of an institution.
Ideally such a template should default to as many of the desired design elements as possible, while allowing 
maximum flexibility for the users to craft the specific content.
Especially with respect to the tools users might want to employ the template should interfere as little as possible.
