The file beamerthemeSAB_2018.sty and the directory beamerthemeSAB_2018_files/ are not specific to the poster 
and should not be changed. 

The file poster.tex (and the files it sources with \input{}) contain the changeable content of the poster.
To distinguish between the different parts of the poster these parts are described in different files, but
You can actually put everything into poster.tex 
You also can of course use a less elaborate directory structure for the images.
The purpuse was to make it obvious which picture you need for what.
