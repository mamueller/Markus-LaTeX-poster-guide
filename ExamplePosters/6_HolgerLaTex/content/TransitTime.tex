If we define the (backward) transit time of a particle as the age of the particle 
at the time when it exits the system, we can easily derive explicit formulas for its distribution 
from the age distribution.\\
The simple approach stock/flux for the transit time is valid only for a system in steady state.

{\color{red}Out of steady state, stock($t$)/flux($t$) cannot be interpreted as a transit time.}
