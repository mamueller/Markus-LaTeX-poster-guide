@article{Kaiser,
	Abstract = {Sorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is considered to be a major process in the preservation of organic matter (OM) in marine sediments. Evidence for this hypothesis includes the close relationship between sediment surface area (SA) and organic carbon (OC) concentrations and the strongly reduced biological degradability after \{DOM\} has sorbed to mineral surfaces. The aim of this study was to discuss the possibility of a similar process in the soil environment. We accomplished this by gathering information from the literature, and by an evaluation of our own studies on \{DOM\} sorption and accumulation of \{OM\} in soil. We found that in soil a close association of \{OM\} with the mineral matrix exists. Both the concentration of soil \{OM\} associated with the mineral matrix, and the sorption of \{DOM\} are related to reactive mineral phases such as Al and Fe oxyhydroxides. Sorption of \{DOM\} derived from the oxidative decomposition of lignocellulose to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides involves strong complexation bondings between surface metals and acidic organic ligands, particularly with those associated with aromatic structures. The strength of the sorption relates to the surface area but more importantly to the surface properties of the sorbing mineral phase. The sorption of a large part of \{DOM\} is hardly reversible under conditions similar to those during sorption (hysteresis). Because sorption of the more labile polysaccharide-derived \{DOM\} on mineral surfaces is weaker, adsorptive and desorptive processes strongly favour the accumulation of the more recalcitrant lignin-derived DOM. In addition, we found the soil \{OM\} in an alluvial B horizon and in the clay fraction of a topsoil strongly resembling lignin-derived \{DOM\} from the overlying forest floors. Hence, it seems likely that sorption of \{DOM\} contributes considerably to the accumulation and preservation of \{OM\} in soil. However, this does not result in a significant relationship between \{OC\} concentration and SA. Reasons for that finding may be the ''masking'' of mineral surfaces by adsorbed OM, the clustering of \{OM\} patches at highly reactive sites of metal hydroxides, and/or the absence of a relationship between \{SA\} and the concentration of surface-active Fe and Al oxyhydroxides in some soil types. Overall, we conclude that sorptive preservation of \{OM\} in soil is affected by the chemical structure of the sorbing \{DOM\} and the surface properties of the mineral matrix. Localisation and conformation of sorbed \{OM\} remains unclear and therefore should be subject of further research. },

	Abstract = {A model has been developed to simulate the dynamics of decomposers and substrates in grasslands. Substrates represented are humic material, feces, and dead plant and animal remains. Except for humic material, substrates are further divided into a rapidly and a slowly decomposing fraction. The proportion of rapidly decomposing material in a substrate is predicted from its initial nitrogen content. The belowground portion of the system is divided into layers because temperature and soil water, the most important driving variables for the model, vary with depth. Decomposition rates are predicted from temperature, water tension, and inorganic nitrogen concentration. Taxonomic groups of decomposers are not distinguished, but distinction is made between active and inactive states, which differ in respiration rate, in death rate, and in that only active decomposers assimilate substrate. The model's predictions compare favorably to data on CO"2 evolution and to litter bag experiments, but not to ATP estimates of active microbial biomass. The model indicates a profound influence of depth on decomposition rates and on decomposer biomass dynamics, growth yield, and secondary productivity.},

@article{Forney12,
	Abstract = {Carbon removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis is released back by respiration. Although some organic carbon is degraded quickly, older carbon persists; consequently carbon stocks are much larger than predicted by initial decomposition rates. This disparity can be traced to a wide range of first-order decay-rate constants, but the rate distributions and the mechanisms that determine them are unknown. Here, we pose and solve an inverse problem to find the rate distributions corresponding to the decomposition of plant matter throughout North America. We find that rate distributions are lognormal, with a mean and variance that depend on climatic conditions and substrate. Changes in temperature and precipitation scale all rates similarly, whereas the initial substrate composition sets the time scale of faster rates. These findings probably result from the interplay of stochastic processes and biochemical kinetics, suggesting that the intrinsic variability of decomposers, substrate and environment results in a predictable distribution of rates. Within this framework, turnover times increase exponentially with the kinetic heterogeneity of rates, thereby providing a theoretical expression for the persistence of recalcitrant organic carbon in the natural environment.},

@article{Parton,
	Abstract = {<abstract abstract-type="summary"> We analyzed climatic and textural controls of soil organic C and N for soils of the U.S. Great Plains. We used a model of soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and composition to simulate steady-state organic matter levels for 24 grassland locations in the Great Plains. The model was able to simulate the effects of climatic gradients on SOM and productivity. Soil texture was also a major control over organic matter dynamics. The model adequately predicted aboveground plant production and soil C and N levels across soil textures (sandy, medium, and fine); however, the model tended to overestimate soil C and N levels for fine textured soil by 10 to 15%. The impact of grazing on the system was simulated and showed that steady-state soil C and N levels were sensitive to the grazing intensity, with soil C and N levels decreasing with increased grazing rates. Regional trends in SOM can be predicted using four site-specific variables, temperature, moisture, soil texture, and plant lignin content. Nitrogen inputs must also be known. Grazing intensity during soil development is also a significant control over steady-state levels of SOM, and since few data are available on presettlement grazing, some uncertainty is inherent in the model predictions.},

Following a brief review of methods for fitting steady state kinetic data, modern methods are highlighted for fitting full progress curve kinetics based upon numerical integration of rate equations, including a re-analysis of the original Michaelis--Menten full time course kinetic data.

	Abstract = {Abstract Single enzyme molecules display inevitable, stochastic fluctuations in their catalytic activity. In metabolism, for instance, the stochastic activity of individual enzymes is averaged out due to their high copy numbers per single cell. However, many processes inside cells rely on single enzyme activity, such as transcription, replication, translation, and histone modifications. Here we introduce the main theoretical concepts of stochastic single-enzyme activity starting from the Michaelis--Menten enzyme mechanism. Next, we discuss stochasticity of multi-substrate enzymes, of enzymes and receptors with multiple conformational states and finally, how fluctuations in receptor activity arise from fluctuations in signal concentration. This paper aims to introduce the exciting field of single-molecule enzyme kinetics and stochasticity to a wider audience of biochemists and systems biologists. },

@article{Yang,
	Abstract = {Electron transfer is used as a probe for angstrom-scale structural changes in single protein molecules. In a flavin reductase, the fluorescence of flavin is quenched by a nearby tyrosine residue by means of photo-induced electron transfer. By probing the fluorescence lifetime of the single flavin on a photon-by-photon basis, we were able to observe the variation of flavin-tyrosine distance over time. We could then determine the potential of mean force between the flavin and the tyrosine, and a correlation analysis revealed conformational fluctuation at multiple time scales spanning from hundreds of microseconds to seconds. This phenomenon suggests the existence of multiple interconverting conformers related to the fluctuating catalytic reactivity.},

	Abstract = {Soil warming has the potential to alter both soil and plant processes that affect carbon storage in forest ecosystems. We have quantified these effects in a large, long-term (7-y) soil-warming study in a deciduous forest in New England. Soil warming has resulted in carbon losses from the soil and stimulated carbon gains in the woody tissue of trees. The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability. This study underscores the importance of incorporating carbon--nitrogen interactions in atmosphere--ocean--land earth system models to accurately simulate land feedbacks to the climate system.},
