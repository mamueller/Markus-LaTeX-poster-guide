Many models in ecology and biogeochemistry, in particular models of the global
carbon cycle, can be generalized as systems of non-autonomous ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). For many applications, it is important to
determine the stability properties for this type of systems, but most methods
available for autonomous systems are not necessarily applicable for the
non-autonomous case.  We discuss here stability notions for non-autonomous
nonlinear models represented by systems of ODEs explicitly dependent on time
and a time-varying input signal.  
Is there a stability concept that is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	broad enough to encompass these models
	\item
	rigorous enough to be proved analytically 
	\item
	interpretable in ecologically meaningful terms ?
\end{enumerate}
