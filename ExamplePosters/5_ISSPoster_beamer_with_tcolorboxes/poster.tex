  % p.s.: We could define the macro here by the content of an input file
  % \newcommand{\myFooter}{
  %   \input{footerContent}
  % }
  % but then footerContent.tex could not contain any macro definitions,
  % since you would define a macro inside a macro...
  % and you would be forced to put your macros in a separate file to be sourced
  % earlier.
  % For the exmaples we wanted to keep the macros only needed in the 
  % footer to stay there.
