\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Autonomous concepts like steady state are clearly insufficient for the analysis of non-autonomous systems.
  \item 
  Nonautonomous techniques are often restricted to linear systems.
  \item
  We propose Input to State Stability (ISS) as
  candidate for the necessary generalization of the established analysis with
  respect to equilibria or invariant sets for autonomous systems, 
  \item 
  In the just puplished  paper \cite{MuellerSierra2017TE} 
  we showed: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
    How ISS generalizes existent concepts formerly only available for Linear Time Invariant (LTI) 
  and Linear Time Variant (LTV) systems to the nonlinear case. 
  \item 
    Exmaples applying it to reservoir models typical for element cycling in
  ecosystem, e.g. in soil organic matter decomposition.  
  \end{itemize}
