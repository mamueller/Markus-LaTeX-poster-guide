We propose Input to State Stability (ISS) as
candidate for the necessary generalization of the established analysis with
respect to equilibria or invariant sets for autonomous systems, and showed for example systems its
usefulness by applying it to reservoir models typical for element cycling in
ecosystem, e.g. in soil organic matter decomposition.  In a forthcoming paper we  also showed how ISS
generalizes existent concepts formerly only available for Linear Time Invariant
(LTI) and Linear Time Variant (LTV) systems to the nonlinear case.
