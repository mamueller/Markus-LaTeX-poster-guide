Beamer boxes can be used inside the columns environment, also provided by the beamer class.
This simplifies some common vertical and horizontal alignment tasks.
\alert{However there is one notable exception that requires a hack:}\\

It is not possible to directly align beamer blocks vertically 
at the top \alert{AND} the bottom of the poster simultaneously for the following reason.
The block environment has no \emph{height} parameter. 
The blocks grow with their content and the header.
We can influence there size only indirectly by wrapping their content in minipages.
The following code defines a minimal environment that allows 
to add extra white space to the blocks.
\inputminted{latex}{content/myBox.tex}
With control over the vertical extent established, we can choose the size of the first box in a column and then use
\LaTeX2e s built in computing facilities (
  \verb1 \dimexpr1 and \verb1 \numexpr1) to determine the size of the second box.
